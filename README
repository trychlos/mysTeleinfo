-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 What is it
 ==========

 mysTeleinfo is a MySensors v2 node
             built on an Arduino Nano
             which decodes EdF Teleinformation thread
             and sends its datas to a Jeedom controller
             via a MySensors v2 serial gateway
             through a NRF24L01 radio communication.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Input/Outputs
 =============

 Input is:
   EdF Teleinformation.

 Outputs are:
   Datas to Jeedom controller
   A thread LED which is on during thread reception
   A HC (resp. HP) LED on during HC (resp. HP) hours.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Features
 ========

 This project features:

 - the interpretation of the EdF Teleinformation thread and its
   transmission to the MySensors gateway

 - a behavior witness via a thread LED which is on during the
   reception of each EdF Teleinformation thread

 - a HC LED which is on during low price hours

 - a HP LED which is on during high prices hours

 - all datas may be retransmitted on request.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Project content
 ===============

 This project includes:

 - docs/: the external documentation used for the project
 - build/: the build resources:
   > Arduino Nano pins layout
   > Kicad electronic scheme
   > the built PCB
 - images/: the .png images used as Jeedom widgets
 - mysTeleinfo.ino: the main Arduino program
 - pwiSoftwareSerial.{h,cpp}: a hacked version of the SoftwareSerial
   library (see NOTES)
 - teleInfo.{h,cpp}: the class used to decode the EdF Teleinformation
   thread
 - teleInfo.dump: a log of the debug output.

 Notes
 =====

   Interruption management

   The hardware IRQ0/IRQ1 (D2/D3) are left free.
   Most of the NRF24 radio module makes use of PortB (PCINT0) pins.
   For this reason, we have chosen to use a PortB (PCINT2) pin to use
   as input for teleinformation.
   Input is managed via SoftwareSerial library. We are using an hacked
   version in order to optimize the software interrupt management.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Interactions
 ============

 The MySensors node present one main ID to the controller, to manage global
 actions and request or set global parameters
 (see. also https://www.jeedom.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=26867
  on child_id's definitions).

 For each configurable parameter:
 - define a specific ChildId
 - parse a received C_SET command with V_CUSTOM message and payload
 - parse a received C_REQ command
 - send a V_VAR1 message to the controller with the value

 Below interactions are defined from MySensors node point of view.
