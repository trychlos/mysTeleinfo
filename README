-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 What is it
 ==========

 mysTeleinfo is a MySensors v2 node
             built on an Arduino Nano
             which decodes EdF Teleinformation thread
             and sends its datas to a Jeedom controller
             via a MySensors v2 serial gateway
             through a NRF24L01 radio communication.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Input/Outputs
 =============

 Input is:
   EdF Teleinformation.

 Outputs are:
   Datas to Jeedom controller
   A thread LED which is on during thread reception
   A HC (resp. HP) LED on during HC (resp. HP) hours.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Features
 ========

 This project features:

 - the interpretation of the EdF Teleinformation thread and its
   transmission to the MySensors gateway

 - a behavior witness via a thread LED which is on during the
   reception of each EdF Teleinformation thread

 - a HC LED which is on during low price hours

 - a HP LED which is on during high prices hours

 - all datas may be retransmitted on request.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Project content
 ===============

 This project includes:

 - docs/resources: the external documentation used for the project
 - docs/NanoConnection.ods: the pins allocation of the Arduino Nano
 - kicad/: the electronic scheme
 - pcb/: the built PCB
 - images/: the .png images used as Jeedom widgets
 - mysTeleinfo.ino: the main Arduino program
 - pwiSoftwareSerial.{h,cpp}: a hacked version of the SoftwareSerial
   library (see NOTES)
 - teleInfo.{h,cpp}: the class used to decode the EdF Teleinformation
   thread
 - teleInfo.dump: a log of the debug output.

 Notes
 =====

   Interruption management

   The hardware IRQ0/IRQ1 (D2/D3) are left free.
   Most of the NRF24 radio module makes use of PortB (PCINT0) pins.
   For this reason, we have chosen to use a PortB (PCINT2) pin to use
   as input for teleinformation.
   Input is managed via SoftwareSerial library. We are using an hacked
   version in order to optimize the software interrupt management.

 Known bugs and limitations
 ==========================

   Cf. TODO
